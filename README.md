#WineQualityPrediction 
Given a set of features as inputs, the task here is to predict the quality of wine on a scale of 0 - 10. I have solved it as a regression problem using Linear Regression.
# Dataset
The dataset used here is Wine Quality Data set from UCI Machine Learning Repository. I have attached the csv file needed for the regression task - winequality-red.csv The same can also be found here https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

fixed acidity
volatile acidity
citric acid
residual sugar
chlorides
free sulfur dioxide
total sulfur dioxide
density
pH
sulphates
alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data): quality (score between 0 and 10)
# Dependencies
Python
Pandas
matplotlib
numpy
scikit-learn
# Setup
Clone the repository
The repo contains the IPython Notebook for prediction task and the dataset as csv file.
Run the ipynb to see the results.
